# Introduction
This repository contains bundle files that define user-defined commands used in [RunAnywhere](https://github.com/Zplutor/RunAnywhere). See this [wiki page](https://github.com/Zplutor/RunAnywhere/wiki/Bundle-File) for more information about bundle files.

You can use these bundle files directly, or refer them as examples to write your own bundle files.

# How to Use
* Before using these bundle files, you should install RunAnywhere first, and select "register file associations" check box during installation.
* Download one of the bundle files.
* Double-click the downloaded file to import it into RunAnywhere.
* Now you can execute commands defined in the file in RunAnywhere.

# Naming Convention
Because bundle files are identified by its file name, we use this naming convention to reduce conflict between files wrote by different author:
```
<Author>.<Module>.ra-bundle
```
